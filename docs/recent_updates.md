# Recent Updates and Implementation Notes

This document summarizes recent updates and implementation details based on our development conversations.

## Fresnel Zone Parameters

### Extraction from PDFs
- Added functionality to extract Fresnel zone parameters from PDFs during AI processing
- Implemented extraction of K factors (K1, K2, K3) and zone percentages (%F1, %F2, %F3)
- Added fallback to default values when no Fresnel information is found in PDFs
- Added alert mechanism to notify users when default values are being used

### Reporting Fresnel Zone
- Added a "Reporting Fresnel" zone that is 115% of the largest Fresnel zone
- This provides a 15% margin of error for reporting and visualizations
- The Reporting Fresnel zone is always used for map and other visualizations
- Other K factor Fresnels are hidden for most visuals unless otherwise stated

### UI Implementation
- Created a new JavaScript file `fresnel_parameters.js` to display Fresnel zone parameters
- Added a table to show K factors, zone percentages, and colors
- Implemented an alert mechanism to notify when default values are being used
- Added styles for the Fresnel parameters display

### API Endpoints
- Added `/get_tower_parameters` endpoint to both Node.js and Python servers
- Implemented proper error handling for the new endpoints

## Python Version Compatibility

### Merger Application
- Updated the "Open in Merger" functionality to use Python 3.10 specifically
- Added a helper method `find_python310()` to search for Python 3.10 in common installation locations
- Created a generic method `run_with_python310()` to run scripts with Python 3.10 if available
- Implemented fallback to system Python if Python 3.10 is not found or fails
- Added better error handling and user feedback

### Synth Application
- Applied the same Python 3.10 compatibility updates to the "Open in Synth" functionality
- Ensured consistent behavior between Merger and Synth applications

## Code Organization

- Refactored duplicate code into helper methods for better maintainability
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved user feedback with informative messages

## Future Considerations

- Consider making the Fresnel zone parameters editable in the UI
- Add multiple visualization options for different Fresnel zones
- Implement a more sophisticated algorithm for calculating Fresnel zone clearance
